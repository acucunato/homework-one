    <p>
        My name is Alyssa Cucunato. I am from New Jersey, but am now a Philadelphia resident. I graduated from Philadelphia University with a Bachelor of Science in Fashion Merchandising.
        <br>
        I have over 10 years of experience working in the fashion industry as a Store Manager and more recently a Store Operations Specialist. I love problem solving, visual merchandising, and creative thinking to achieve results. While I enjoy and love the industry, it became mundane, I wanted to be challenged again so it was time for a much needed a career change. I am hoping to continue to utilize skills learned in my previous industry to embark on this new journey in coding and web development.
        <br>
        In my free time I enjoy traveling, spending time with my large, loud and crazy Italian family, and going down the shore. My favorite days are spent watching a Harry Potter marathon with my shihtzu dog, my boyfriend and some wine.
