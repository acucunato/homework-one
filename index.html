    <p>
        My name is Alyssa Cucunato. I am from New Jersey, but just recently moved to Philadelphia. I have a Fashion Merchandising Degree from Philadelphia University, and have 10 years of experience in the fashion industry.
        <br>
        I am the oldest child in my house with a younger sister and brother. My family consists of a ton of loud, and crazy Italians but I wouldn't trade it for the world. My obsession is my shihtzu mix Lola, she is the cutest and best dog. I am a huge Harry potter phanatic; the best books out there! Some of my favorite things to do are going to the shore, hanging out with my friends, traveling, cooking and shopping.
